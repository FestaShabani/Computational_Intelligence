    "The recursive_dls function is the recursive part of the search. It explores the graph depth-first up to a certain depth limit. It has the following logic:\n",

    "If the depth_limit is 0, it returns an empty list because it has reached the depth limit without finding the goal.\n",
    "If the depth_limit is greater than 0, it iterates through the neighbors of the current node. For each neighbor, it recursively calls recursive_dls with a reduced depth_limit. If a non-empty result is obtained from the recursive call, it means a path to the goal has been found, and the function returns a list starting with the current node and followed by the rest of the path.\n",
